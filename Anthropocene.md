December of 2020, I started looking for roles in companies that interested me the most. I wrote over 19 personalized cover letters, many other applications, and diligently researched the companies in the Seattle area whose goals most closely aligned with mine and my skillset could bring the most value. The New Year started, and mid January I got a call from a small company with about 200 employees that did consulting and project management in information technology. The secret? The project I had done for streamlining the veterans' claims. It caught the recruiter's eye, it demonstrated the wide skillset that I had, captured in just a few lines on my resume in the "projects" section. After 5 interviews, I was extended an offer to a challenging, exciting position that I didn't think was possible within the next 5 years.

My experience over the past 8 months has been a whirlwind of learning new technologies, getting to exchange ideas with wonderful, intelligent people, and has given me the opportunity to grow immensely. Lucas Meyer, a Foster alum and a data scientist shared with the MSBA class his experience at Microsoft and Amazon during one of our leadership classes. During the Q and A, I asked him, how are you able to create these models to find these insights? They seem to be incredibly complex for one person. And his answer will also resonate with me, he said "I don't do anything alone. The model I showed you today that I used at Amazon was created on the backs of giants, 40 people from all throughout history and with a willingness to share knowlege made this possible". Of all the experiences and knowledge I learned, I keep coming back to this idea, that our purpose is to build up those around us and collaborate together. The sum of our collective knowledge is more than any one individual.
