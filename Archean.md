*Going on a morning run, and talking the plan of the day for the Foster School of Business:MSBA Instagram followers*

I volunteered to be a student ambassador, and it was an incredibly enjoyable experience. The purpose of the student ambassador program is to foster the community between current students and prospective students.  Many prospective students reached out to me, via LinkedIn or Instagram, after I did a “Day in the Life” of a student in the MSBA program, which was a story detailing of what my typical daily experience on the MSBA Instagram account. I hope those conversations really encouraged others to follow their passion, and in the same way they reinspired me, because I became aware that hundreds of others were out there, seeking many of the same answers I was.
