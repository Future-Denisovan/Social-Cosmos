The reason I transitioned careers is that the use and application of insights gained from data has the potential of transforming our world for the better. My first step in this journey was to apply to and gain acceptance to a learning pathway with instructors that were experts in the subject. I excitedly waited for the results of my application to the University of Washington, Foster School of Business, Master of Science Business Analytics program, which was my top choice and an ambitious reach.

When I learned I was accepted, I was incredibly excited-I would be able to exchange the thoughts and ideas with others about our current world and the possibilities of the future. The future described by optimists such as Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, who paints a picture in *Hit Refresh* of ethical technology companies leading the way in mending societal injury. Or the future of a multicultural, global, interconnected world that shares a love of life-long learning, like Thomas Friedman describes in *Thank you for Being Late*. 

Even as I confirmed my enrollment in February 2020, there was a shadow that loomed over our world that many of us connected to the intelligence and online communities had been aware of long before but naively hoped those in charge were planning for. My friends and I in the military watched in alarm as many so called leaders dismissed a global pandemic for political expediency.    

As I started school in June, I was felt so privileged to have an opportunity to learn while so many others risk of mortality had significantly increased, or were losing their jobs. Although I could not exchange ideas before and after class with my cohort in person, I could take advantage of forced isolation and volunteer my time to improve some process and learn a new skill.

Discussing with a friend of mine that was a regional sales manager what I had learned in class that week, I asked him about what key performance indicators he used to measure his sales and what format he received them in. I was surprised to learn that he received over a hundred PDF pages of sales data for over twenty stores from all over the western United States each month. Even if he studied a page a day, what insight would he glean? How would he compare store performance? Performance for products over time? This was a process that could be immensely improved with just the organization of data.

## Business Report Converter

##### Using the avaliable software libraries of Camelot and PySimpleGUI, I created a program in Python where a user can convert multiple store reports from different periods in PDF format to a sortable excel with the location of the store and the period in the row.  

I poured my free time into building a program for him that translated the PDF reports he received and output them in Excel files that are sortable, allowing him to make data driven sales decisions. How this project benefited me is I helped bring value to an organization that provides high quality products to customers and sharpened the coding skills I had learned in class.
